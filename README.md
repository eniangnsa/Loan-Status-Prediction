# Loan-Status-Prediction

This is a project that predicts if a person will repay a loan or not based on the 
data. It is a classification problem, and we used the svm.SVC classifier. 

The model had a good accuracy, above 70% which is satisfactorily given that the training examples were 
not so large. We could have achieved higher accuracy if we had much more data.
